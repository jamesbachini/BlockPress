# BlockPress

## Concept

Trust in legacy media is at an all time low. We need somewhere for creators to post content longer than 280 characters that is censorship resistant and dedicated to free speech.

Blockpress is somewhere between Wordpress and a React app but the reusable code modules are stored within a smart contract.

A creator can choose the look of their site, import the modules they want for menus, comment sections or token based memberships. Then write a blog post, article or news story and store it on-chain, immutable forever.

There are no more monthly fees for hosting or cloud services, pay a tx fee for blockspace when posting and then never worry about it again.

A censorship resistant platform where creators and communities can share ideas without interference.

Decentralize publishing to bypass biased systems and connect directly with your audience.
