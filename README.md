## Concept

Trust in legacy media is at an all time low, there is a gap in the market for somewhere creators can post content longer than 280 characters that is censorship resistant and dedicated to free speech.

Blockpress is somewhere between Wordpress and a React app but the reusable code modules are stored within a smart contract.

A creator can choose the look of their site, import the modules they want for menus, comment sections and novel unique web3 options like token based memberships. Then the author writes a blog post, article or news story and stores it on-chain, immutable forever.

No one selling your data, no monthly fees for hosting or cloud services, pay a tx fee for blockspace when posting and then never worry about it again.

Here’s how it works:

[Discuss the integrated tech stack]

BlockPress is a censorship resistant web3 platform where communities can share ideas without interference.

Decentralize publishing to bypass biased systems and connect directly with your audience.
